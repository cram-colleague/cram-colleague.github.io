<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Cram!</h3>


<p>Working on a project or studying for a test and wishing you could get some help? As young college students majoring in computer science, we've all been there. We know that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and believe collaboration, in the form of study groups, will help to strengthen student’s weaknesses by drawing on the strengths of the group. At times school can be stressful and overwhelming and gathering others contact information and arranging times to study is the last thing on a student’s mind. We at cram seek to facilitate the formation of study groups via our app. It is our hope that our app allows students to collaborate, learn, and succeed!</p>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>




<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>


<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>


<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>


<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

        <p>Cram is designed around UH Manoa's CAS login system, allowing anyone in the UH system to login with no registration.  Here is what the homepage will look like after you log in</p>


<img src="/images/home.png" width="600" border="3">
        
<br><br>
        
        <p>After logging in for the first time, you will be prompted to make a new profile to tell everyone who you are and what interests you.  After entering a few tidbits of info, a profile will be created.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>This created profile is what represents you, and is what other users will see when they click on your name.</p>
<br><br>
        


<img src="/images/profile.png" width="600" border="3">
 
<br><br>
        
        <p>After a profile is created, study sessions can be made.  Going to study sessions is what Cram is about, and it aims to encourage collaboration through this.</p>
        
        <br>
 
<img src="/images/Study_Sessions.png" width="600" border="3">
 
<br><br>
        <p>Going to study sessions should be encouraged, so there is a leaderboard showing who has created the most study sessions and who hasn't</p>
<img src="/images/leaderboard.png" width="600" border="3">
 
<br><br>
        
        <p>Even though lots of study sessions is a good thing, and we encourage it... Sometimes they can be abused.  That is why there is a report system to report sessions where no one showed up, or fake one.</p>


        <br>
        <img src="/images/report.png" width="600" border="3">
        <p>Admins on the side can view these reports and change or delete study sessions if they are not valid.  They can also change or edit a user's profile incase of profanity.</p>
